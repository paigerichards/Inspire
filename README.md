# Inspire
> Ruby on Rails app

*The Idea:*
  *For my project I wanted to build an application that would benefit aspiring writers. I wanted the users to be able to upload an excerpt of a novel they've written, interest other users and have the possibility of income with users buying the full versions. I wanted to expand this further to job opportunities. I decided that I would integrate a jobs section that would allow users to just click 'apply' and their information would be directly sent to the employer. From there the employer can view all the posts they've made, reviewed and liked. I also wanted to make it a bit more fun with a competition section. I firstly restricted these to fields allowing only businesses that sign up being able to make job and competition posts but no novel posts. Later, I agreed with my tutor that this produced limitations within my app and I decided to give each user the ability to create any type of post, with the decision to sign up as a writer, business or critic was later scrapped.*

# Inspiration

*Below I have incorporated some of my inspiration for my app. I explored the fundamentals of the API applications and user interfaces of both Instagram and Facebook and somewhat of LinkedIn.*

-  ![](images/instagram.jpg)

Instagram has many great features, the app enables the user to search by; location, tags, usernames/actual names, follow users, contact them and tag them in posts, either one the user has made or in a comment. What appeals me to Instagram is its easy user experience, its simplistic and not complicated, quite straightforward.  Facebook is VERY much simpler. Facebook allows the users to become friends which is much like the follow method on Instagram and connect option n LinkedIn. One thing that really stuck out about Facebook was its ability to have changeable newsfeeds; defaulted and customizable ones by the user.

After looking closely at these two apps, for my app, I'd like the user to be able to search specific for the page. For example if they are on the Job's page, the will only be given results with jobs relating to the title, experience level and location. I also want to implement a follow option, that will then give the user a 'following feed' with the root page displaying all users posts. This follow option will be found on their profile and will be located next to a contact button. Like Facebook, I would like to implement a Top Stories and Most Recent newsfeed filter.

I like how all applications use a simplistic icon navigation system at the bottom of the screen page on mobile. I would like to keep this idea consistent across all screen sizes with possibly having the bottom navigation, stick to the right hand side at approx. 800px+ width.

Having a look at LinkedIn, I really liked the interface of the profile page. I liked the idea of having a round picture with a frame including the person's full name, location, connections and beginning of a bio. I'm thinking of using a similar design.

The user will be able to have...
- A username, but with the ability to login with email or username
- A profile picture
- A record of their posts, reviews and likes accessible from their profile
- Feed filters, eg; posts, jobs, competitions and top stories and most recent
- Ability to view other users profiles
- Ability to follow a user
- Ability to contact user
- Ability to apply for jobs and competitions
- Search specific to the page
- Ability to buy full versions of novels
- Ability to like a post
- Ability to review and rate a post
- Ability to report inappropriate comments
- Ability to see overall rate of a post
- Biography

I'm more leaning to creating my app with a closely feel of Instagram for the as I feel like the design in place is more inviting than Facebook and Linkedin with its use of color.

# Wireframes
*For the creation of my wireframes, I used Photoshop.*
*Across all media platforms I wanted to keep my design simple and easy to use.*

Sign Up process

>This is the Sign Up page. As you can see its very simple and easy to use. I kept this same structure and design throughout all media platforms. I decided to use an image behind the sign up box with a color fill as I think it adds a nice touch, its inviting and the coffee and boo highlights relaxation. The use of this blue will become a color theme within my app.

Mockup:
![](images/mockup.jpg)
This was a mockup I created to get a real feel for my design and how it would be represented on mobile screen.

# Changes / Improvements

*I began to code by this stage and had most of the technical elements and style coded. I kept coming back to my design and I figured I needed more information about myself and a couple more pages to really show off my skills and desire to be a web developer. This then led me to the creation of the pages; skills and contact. I then furthered changes to design of the links to pages; instead of having them displayed as an inline-block, I wanted them as blocks.*

# Challenges
*My first idea for the vines was to make them grow around the page when loaded. I searched online for a while on how to do this and I found a step by step guide using Javascript. I decided not to go ahead with it, as I understood very little of the technicality being implemented. I plan in the future to update my site and do this once I've learnt Javascript in a bit more depth.
I faced issues with a type face 'CAC Champagne', that I so desperately wanted to use but would not render in its proper form on IOS. This then led me to use the google font 'Italianno' for my h1.*

# Code & Validation
*For SEO purposes and for personal preference, I wanted to validate my code. I went through and validated all my HTML and CSS pages and made changes until I received this message*

As you can see above, each page has been successfully passed with no errors.

# Finished Product
*After redesigning and coding I'm finally at the stage of a finished product.*

I'm pleased with the outcome of my portfolio website, it reflects my objectives I originally wanted; simple yet appealing and informative.
