# Inspire
> Ruby on Rails app

*The Idea:*
  *For my project I wanted to build an application that would benefit aspiring writers. I wanted the users to be able to upload an excerpt of a novel they've written, interest other users and have the possibility of income with users buying the full versions. I wanted to expand this further to job opportunities. I decided that I would integrate a jobs section that would allow users to just click 'apply' and their information would be directly sent to the employer. From there the employer can view all the posts they've made, reviewed and liked. I also wanted to make it a bit more fun with a competition section. I firstly restricted these to fields allowing only businesses that sign up being able to make job and competition posts but no novel posts. Later, I agreed with my tutor that this produced limitations within my app and I decided to give each user the ability to create any type of post, with the decision to sign up as a writer, business or critic was later scrapped.*

# Inspiration

*Below I have incorporated some of my inspiration for my app. I explored the fundamentals of the API applications and user interfaces of both Instagram and Facebook and somewhat of LinkedIn.*

-  ![](images/facebook.jpg)
-  ![](images/linkedin.jpg)
-  ![](images/instagram.jpg)

Instagram has many great features, the app enables the user to search by; location, tags, usernames/actual names, follow users, contact them and tag them in posts, either one the user has made or in a comment. What appeals me to Instagram is its easy user experience, its simplistic and not complicated, quite straightforward.  Facebook is VERY much simpler. Facebook allows the users to become friends which is much like the follow method on Instagram and connect option n LinkedIn. One thing that really stuck out about Facebook was its ability to have changeable newsfeeds; defaulted and customizable ones by the user.

After looking closely at these two apps, for my app, I'd like the user to be able to search specific for the page. For example if they are on the Job's page, the will only be given results with jobs relating to the title, experience level and location. I also want to implement a follow option, that will then give the user a 'following feed' with the root page displaying all users posts. This follow option will be found on their profile and will be located next to a contact button. Like Facebook, I would like to implement a Top Stories and Most Recent newsfeed filter.

I like how all applications use a simplistic icon navigation system at the bottom of the screen page on mobile. I would like to keep this idea consistent across all screen sizes with possibly having the bottom navigation, stick to the right hand side at approx. 800px+ width.

Having a look at LinkedIn, I really liked the interface of the profile page. I liked the idea of having a round picture with a frame including the person's full name, location, connections and beginning of a bio. I'm thinking of using a similar design.

The user will be able to have...
- A username, but with the ability to login with email or username
- A profile picture
- A record of their posts, reviews and likes accessible from their profile
- Feed filters, eg; posts, jobs, competitions and top stories and most recent
- Ability to view other users profiles
- Ability to follow a user
- Ability to contact user
- Ability to apply for jobs and competitions
- Search specific to the page
- Ability to buy full versions of novels
- Ability to like a post
- Ability to review and rate a post
- Ability to report inappropriate comments
- Ability to see overall rate of a post
- Biography

I'm more leaning to creating my app with a closely feel of Instagram for the as I feel like the design in place is more inviting than Facebook and Linkedin with its use of color.

# Wireframes
*For the creation of my wireframes, I used Photoshop.*
*Across all media platforms I wanted to keep my design simple and easy to use.*

iPhone 6
>Sign Up process

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Login.jpg)
>This is the Sign Up page. As you can see its very simple and easy to use. I kept this same structure and design throughout all media platforms. I decided to use an image behind the sign up box with a color fill as I think it adds a nice touch, its inviting and the coffee and boo highlights relaxation. The use of this blue will become a color theme within my app.



  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Sign UP.jpg)
>I want the user to click the sign up button and then be brought to this page where they will fill out their personal details and chose a password. The will have the option to continue or cancel. Again I have used a background image with a colour fill, this time purple.

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Sign Up Page 2.jpg)
>This is the second process of the sign up, you will chose a username, chose what you are and upload a profile picture. You will again have the option to continue or cancel. I kept the same image and colour fill as they are related pages.

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Sign up - Payment.jpg)
>This is the third and final process of the sign up, this is where you will create your monthly subscription. You will again have the option to continue or cancel. I kept the same image and colour fill as they are related pages.

![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Success Sign Up.jpg)
>Once sign up is successfully the user will be sent to this page. I have decided to use a different image at this stage and a red colour fill.


> Newsfeeds

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Newsfeed.jpg)
>This is the post feed. This will be the root page of my site. To keep color consistency I have used the same blue at the login page to theme this page. As you can see, I have show what the navigation will look like for changing to top stories or most recent and what kind of newsfeed is displayed.

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Following.jpg)
>Again keeping within the colors I have chosen, the Following feed will be themed purple. As you can see the highlighted area (if your a business) has given you the option to post a job or competition (after clicking the + sign in the middle of the bottom nav). This is still a functional feature, however the decision to all users to create all types of posts has been made. Edit seen in wireframes made below.

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Post Job.jpg)
>For Jobs, I used a color theme that would go nicely with both the purple and blue chosen for previous pages. As you can see I have created the posts in two columns, I later realized this will become an issue for readability on such mobile as the iPhone six. Changes where later made to have one post across full page, the columns will be seen on desktop and iPad retina.

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Compettions.jpg)
> The colour scheme for competitions is the same of that of the congratulations page. Again like jobs, the two column split for mobile of this size will be edited.

>Creating Posts
I have kept the colour scheme of newsfeeds related to the creation of post.

  ![](images/iphone-6/iphone-6Create Post.jpg)
> This wireframe is of the process to create a general post of a novel the user has created.
